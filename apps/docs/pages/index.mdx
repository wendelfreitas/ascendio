# Introduction

Ascendio is a powerful CLI tool that streamlines the setup of a monorepo project. By automating the configuration of essential tools and libraries, it saves developers time and ensures consistency across projects.

# What is exactly Ascendio?

Ascendio is a pre-configured project structure that simplifies the setup of new projects based on your choices in the terminal. However, it includes some mandatory configurations to ensure clean, well-organized, and well-typed code, making developers' lives easier in the long run.

# Mandatory Configurations

- **ESLint**: Ensures code quality and consistency by enforcing coding standards.
- **Prettier**: Automatically formats your code to maintain a consistent style.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing to catch errors early and improve code reliability.
- **Commitlint**: Enforces consistent commit messages to maintain a clean project history.
- **pnpm**: A fast, disk space-efficient package manager.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework, integrated via shadcn-ui for styling.
- **Lint-staged**: Runs linters on staged git files to ensure code quality before commits.
- **Turborepo**: Efficiently manages monorepos, optimizing builds and tests.

  These mandatory tools are integrated because we believe in maintaining high
  code quality, which includes clean, organized, and well-typed code. By
  including these configurations, Ascendio helps you create a robust foundation
  for your projects, facilitating future development and maintenance.
